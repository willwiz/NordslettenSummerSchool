# NordslettenSummerSchool
For Graz Biomechanical Summer School

### Before Getting Started

Before you get started, make sure to install python. To avoid contaminating your default Python setup, please use a virtual environment.

To create a virtual environment, e.g. in .venv of the current working directory, use the command
```console
python -m venv ./.venv
```
Activate your virtual environment. If you are using Windows, use
```console
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
If you are using Linux, macOS, or other Unix systems, use
```console
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
You can exit the virtual environment at any time by executing the command `deactivate`

## Getting Started

The NordslettenSummerSchool python module and all dependencies can be installed with `pip`.

For example, after you git clone or download the `nordsletten_summer_school` directory, you can install it with

```console
pip install ./nordsletten_summer_school
```
In case your `pip` executable is not bound to the same `python` executable, you call pip from python. I.e., you can alternatively call
```console
python -m pip install ./nordsletten_summer_school
```

If your current directory is inside `nordsletten_summer_school`, you can install the module via
```console
python -m pip install .
```

Once this is done, you are ready to go.
